# peer-wizardamigosinstitute
**work in progress** - Wizard Amigo Profile Page Template

## idea
after forking this repository, one can edit his/her personal config/settings file to adapt the `organization` and `service` view of **wizardamigosinstitute** for oneself and others, because those views take into account all the forks of `peer-wizardamigosinstititute` repositories.

# usage
fork this repository and then edit your local `config.json` file to customize :-)

## contribute
if you happen to have more ideas about how exactly this could work, please open an issue and share your ideas/feedback :-)
