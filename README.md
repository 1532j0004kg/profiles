# peer-wizardamigosinstitute
**work in progress** - Wizard Amigo Profile Page Template

## idea
after forking this repository, one can edit his/her personal config/settings file to adapt the `organization` and `service` view of **wizardamigosinstitute** for oneself and others, because those views take into account all the forks of `peer-wizardamigosinstititute` repositories.

# usage
1. **fork** this repository and then edit your local `config.json` file to customize :-)
2. **go to** `settings` on your forked repository version
3. **scroll** to `GitHub Pages/Source`, **select** `master branch` and **click** `Save`
4. **click** `Edit` in the header description and fill out custom *Website* link:
  * `https://{{username}}.github.io/peer-wizardamigosinstitute` where you replace `{{username}}` with your **github username**
  * then **click** `Save`
5. **click** the newly displayed link to open your version of the website :-)
